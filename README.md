#CharEd

A crossplatform wxWidgets based character/font editor for Commodore 64 character sets written in Python. It's been tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows, with wxPython 2.8 and 3.0.

It only supports hires 1x1 chars, but it has a few useful features:
- Auto create reversed charsets. Copies the first 128 chars to the latter 128 and reverses the latter.
- Import Amiga font files. Only 8x8 bitmap fonts is supported. As far as I know no other similar tools does this.
- Easily replace or fill selected characters with standard kernal chars, for example PETSCII drawing characters.

More features hopefully to come soon.
