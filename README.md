#CharEd

A crossplatform wxWidgets based character/font editor for Commodore 64 character sets written in Python. It's been tested on Linux and Windows, with wxPython 2.8 and 3.0.

At the moment it's rather minimal. It only supports hires 1x1 and can only load and save raw bitmap files.

More features hopefully to come soon.

Windows users that does not want to install Python can use the stand alone binary at http://mikeri.net/CharEd.zip, but please note that this is not always up to date.
